This repository demonstrates a common Python error: ZeroDivisionError, which occurs when dividing by zero.  The `bug.py` file shows the error occurring when an empty list is passed to the average calculation function.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution by adding a check for empty lists, returning 0 in that case.  Understanding how to handle potential division by zero is crucial for robust Python programming.
